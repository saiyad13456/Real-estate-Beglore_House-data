# Real-estate-Beglore_House-data
I got a Bangalore real estate dataset from Kaggle, imported it into Power BI, and used Power Query and DAX functions for cleaning and analysis. Extracted insights include total_sqft by area_type, availability by area_type, size by balcony, and counts by size and area_type. Identified top-5 and bottom-5 societies with the most flats.
